William Mairs & Katya Malison

We generated our hypotheses together.  Will wrote the brief descriptions of them
while Katya drew up our example visualizations.

Katya and Will both performed the experiment on different groups of participants, and
compiled csv files separately.  Will created the (ugly) writeup pdf and visualization.
