1. first method: 4 points in the ab plane and then rotate
	try to find 8 equidistant points in L*a*b space geometrically
	point 1 50, -80, 0
	point 2 60, -70 -80
	point 3 100, 0, -90
	point 4 
	point 5
	point 6
	point 7
	point 8


2. all in the ab plane


3. random method
	1st algorithm for determing if a color palette is 'better'
	compute random rbg value on each call to draw
	compare previous best avg / previous best sd with new avg / sd
	if new value higher, update best values and best colors
	
	2nd algorithm
	avg / std squared	

	3rd
	std squared / avg
